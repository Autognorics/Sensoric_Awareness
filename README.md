# Sensoric Awareness 
[HOME](https://autognorics.github.io/) 

In the article "_The robot who didn't know he is Alive!_", Lawsin redefined Aliveness or being alive based on the ability of an organism or machine to self-consume energy.  In human vocabulary, self-consumption of energy means consuming food by eating. In machines, it means self-recharging its battery or power source.

However, although the machine is alive, Lawsin argued that definitely it is not aware, conscious, intuitive, neural, and living. Based on his work Autognorics, he discovered that for an organism or machine to be AWARE, it needs two things:

(1). It is alive, and;
(2). It is equipped with intuitive objects.

Intuitive Objects (IOs), or Exyzforms, are natural objects that receive input and transmit output signals. Examples of intuitive objects are the eyes, nose, ears, skin, tongue, and brain. Other exyzforms in the human body that are unfamiliar to most of us are the biological sensor that detects body temperature or the sensor that balances our gait while walking. All these sensors may look different but in reality, they are all one and the same. Technically, they can be classified as Actuators and Collectors devices. However, actuators and collectors are structurally and functionally the same and work much like a radio transmitter and receiver tandem or the classical string telephone system. BTW, the largest sensor in all living things that evolved and eventually created all the other biological sensors is the SKIN. 

According to the Lawsin, biological sensors are classified as exyzforms or intuitive objects because they evolve naturally with an embedded set of instructions through a process Lawsin called Inscription. This inscripted algorithm makes exyzforms structurally intuitive through its design much like a circle in any shapes that always create a pi. Exyzforms also receive and transmit the same type of signals. These signals that come and go on the same exact wise sensors are nothing but waves that move up and down in rhythmic binary behaviors.  

Awareness does not emanate from the brain. This is a misconception. Awareness is a system and by-product of IOs. Without sensors, awareness will not exist.  As enumerated in the previous article, there are many living organisms that do not have brains but are aware due to the fact that these creatures have sensors and not because they have brains. 

In the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qHTKruqrwc&feature=emb_title), the machine is made up of sensors.  It can navigate itself because it is supplied with sensors that do certain tasks. Its walking cadence is embedded by its design, a natural instruction uncovered by Lawsin in his Biotronics experiments. He called this phenomenon as Inscription by Design or ID. 

The state of being the machine exhibits is known as Sensoric Awareness. This is the second characteristic of Life according to the study on Originemology.
